2. **Communicate Early** - If problems arise, inform the team immediately, not at the deadline
3. **Stay Reachable** - Keep communication channels open and respond in a timely manner
4. **Take Ownership** - Accept responsibility for your commitments and deliverables

2. The warning is **logged** in the system
3. For the **3rd warning**, the member is immediately **dropped** from the team

## 🔄 Appeal Process

2. Provide documentation or evidence supporting your case
3. The manager will review and make a final decision
